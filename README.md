<br/>
This GitHub repo includes the final code for all the modules in the course 

### 8/26/2023 - Course patch update including new module 7 on React Server Components 

## App Description

Creating WCAG 2.2 Test Cases to get executed using Assistive Technologies to provide better Digital Accessibility.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/narayananpalani/wcag2.2TestCases.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/narayananpalani/wcag2.2TestCases/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`



## Directory Structure Here

The easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
